# Galaxy - AI Civilization Evolution Simulator

This project simulates how AI civilizations can discover solutions that surpass human capabilities. It is designed to run directly on local machines, allowing you to observe the evolutionary process in action.

## Prototype Philosophy

**LLM Role**: Instead of solving problems directly, the LLM generates and proposes **"strategies," "heuristics," and "surrogate models"** as code. This creative process is simulated through the LLM_propose_strategy function.

**Evolution Process**: Each AI civilization (agent group) proposes strategies that are executed and evaluated in a "Crucible" environment. Superior strategies are selected by the "Evolutionary Engine" and become the foundation for the next generation.

**Purpose**: These prototypes aim to verify whether the process of discovering better solutions can be automated and accelerated, rather than completely solving the problem.

**This Prototype**: AI civilizations are tasked with inventing surrogate models to accelerate computationally expensive N-body simulations (gravitational calculations). Fitness is evaluated based on the balance between the surrogate model's prediction accuracy and computational speed.

## Setup

### Requirements
- Python 3.10 or higher
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) package manager (recommended) or pip
- Google AI API key (free)

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/TheIllusionOfLife/Galaxy.git
cd Galaxy
```

2. **Install uv (if not already installed)**
```bash
# macOS/Linux
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Windows
powershell -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"

# Alternative: with pip
pip install uv
```

3. **Install dependencies**
```bash
# With uv (recommended - faster and more reliable)
uv sync --extra dev

# Alternative: with pip
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

**Why uv?** uv is 10-100x faster than pip and provides reproducible installs via `uv.lock`. Dependencies install in seconds instead of minutes.

4. **Configure API key**
- Get a free API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey)
- Create a `.env` file in the project root:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```
- Edit the `.env` file and set your API key:
```
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

## Usage

### Basic Execution

```bash
# Run evolutionary optimization
uv run python prototype.py

# Alternative: with pip/venv (activate virtual environment first)
source .venv/bin/activate  # if using venv
python prototype.py
```

### Execution Results

The program outputs:
- **Console:** Evaluation results for each generation (fitness, accuracy, speed)
- **Console:** Top-performing models and LLM usage statistics
- **Files:** Automatically generated visualization and data export

#### Visualization and Data Export

After evolution completes, results are automatically saved to a timestamped directory (`results/run_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS/`):

1. **evolution_history.json** - Complete evolution history with summary statistics
   - All generations, populations, fitness values
   - Best/average/worst fitness per generation
   - Total models evaluated and best overall fitness

2. **fitness_progression.png** - Line plot showing fitness over generations
   - Best, average, and worst fitness trends
   - Identifies improvement/stagnation patterns

3. **accuracy_vs_speed.png** - Scatter plot of accuracy vs speed trade-offs
   - Each point represents one model from any generation
   - Color indicates fitness level
   - Reveals Pareto frontier of speed/accuracy balance

4. **token_progression.png** - Code length evolution over generations
   - Average, maximum, and minimum token counts per generation
   - Individual model scatter overlay colored by fitness
   - Monitors code bloat and validates length penalty effectiveness

5. **cost_progression.png** - Cumulative cost over API calls
   - Tracks spending throughout evolution
   - Helps validate cost estimates

Example output:
```

  - **Problem**: Token bloat in later generations (Gen 0: 1,038 → Gen 3-4: 2,271 avg tokens, +119%)
  - **Solution**: Configurable fitness penalty system to discourage unnecessarily long code
  - **Implementation**:
    - Token counting: `count_tokens()` function (whitespace-based, noted for tiktoken upgrade)
    - Fitness penalty: Linear penalty with 10% floor, only applied above threshold (2000 tokens)
    - Configuration: 3 new settings (enable, weight, threshold) with defaults

#### Next Priority Tasks
1. **[Code Length Penalty - Comparative Testing]**: Enable penalty and compare results
   - Implementation: Complete ✓
   - Baseline: Complete ✓ (penalty disabled, avg 247 tokens across Gen 1-4)
   - Next: Run with penalty enabled (weights: 0.05, 0.1, 0.2) and analyze impact
   - Goal: Validate penalty reduces token growth without harming fitness

#### Known Issues / Blockers
- **Non-monotonic Fitness**: Fitness fluctuates between generations (not guaranteed to improve)
  - Expected behavior during exploration phase, not a bug

#### Session Learnings
- **GraphQL PR Review Efficiency**: Single comprehensive query fetches all feedback sources
  - Pattern: `query { repository { pullRequest { comments, reviews, reviewThreads, statusCheckRollup } } }`
  - Advantage: Single API call vs multiple CLI commands (3 `gh api` calls + parsing)
  - Coverage: PR comments, reviews, line comments, CI annotations all in one query
- **Zip Pattern Optimization**: Tuple comprehension + `zip(*iterable)` cleaner than intermediate lists
  - Anti-pattern: `list1 = []; list2 = []; for x in data: list1.append(x.a); list2.append(x.b)`
  - Better: `valid = [(x.a, x.b) for x in data if condition]; a_list, b_list = zip(*valid)`
  - Benefit: More Pythonic, fewer variables, clearer intent
- **Complete Test Coverage for Edge Cases**: Test "all data missing" not just "some data missing"
  - Example: PR #16 added test_plot_token_progression_all_models_missing_tokens
  - Rationale: Different code path when ALL vs SOME models lack token_count
  - Pattern: Empty list handling often differs from partial data handling
- **Documentation Code Completeness**: Examples must be runnable, not fragments
  - Anti-pattern: Code snippet missing variable initialization, imports, error handling
  - Consequence: Users copy-paste non-working code, creates support burden
  - Fix: Include complete context (imports, initialization, error checks)
- **TDD with Real API Integration**: Integration tests catch format issues mocks miss
  - Mock limitation: Assumes response format, may not match reality
  - Real API advantage: Validates actual LLM output format, timing, error handling
  - Best practice: Write unit tests with mocks, verify with real API before merge
- **TDD Integration Test Implementation**: Empty tests with `pass` should be implemented or removed
  - Anti-pattern: Placeholder tests that don't validate behavior
  - Solution: Either implement with mock data validation or remove entirely
  - PR #14 example: Implemented penalty calculation validation test
- **Security Review Priority**: API keys, credentials, secrets take absolute precedence
  - Even one exposed key blocks merge regardless of feature quality
  - Check for .env*, *.backup, *.bak files before committing
  - Git remove immediately, then revoke/regenerate keys
- **Code Simplification from AI Review**: Trust AI suggestions for redundant code
  - Gemini correctly identified redundant list comprehension in token counting
  - Redundant checks (settings, token_count > 0) can be removed if logic handles edge cases
  - Simpler code is more maintainable and often faster
- **Test Assertion Precision**: Exact assertions > Range assertions
  - Range assertions (e.g., `assert 50 < tokens < 150`) hide actual expected values
  - Exact assertions (`assert tokens == 86`) document intended behavior
  - Narrow ranges (`assert 80 <= tokens <= 90`) acceptable for LLM/approximation variance
- **Prompt Engineering for Code Completeness**: Explicit bracket counting and completeness verification reduces syntax errors
  - Key technique: "Count ALL opening ( [ { MUST have matching closing ) ] }" instruction
  - Special warning for long code (>2000 chars) prevents truncation
  - "Completeness > Cleverness" mindset reduces complex incomplete code
- **LLM Syntax Error Patterns**: Errors occur more in long/complex code (3000+ tokens) during explore phase (temp 1.0)
- **Statistical Testing Importance**: Single runs insufficient - need multiple runs (3+) to validate error rate improvements
- **Unbound Variable Bug Pattern**: Always initialize variables before conditional blocks that use them later
- **TDD Bug Discovery**: Writing integration tests revealed pre-existing UnboundLocalError in production code
- **uv Migration Success**: Switching from pip to uv requires `--extra dev` flag for optional dependencies
- **Make Target Purpose**: `make check` should exclude slow integration tests for quick local validation
- **Test Robustness**: Conditional assertions (e.g., cost_progression.png only if API succeeded) prevent flaky tests
- **Pre-commit Setup**: Tool invocations need `uv run` wrapper when using uv-managed environments
- **Reviewer Priority**: Read review CONTENT not just STATE; even APPROVED reviews can have suggestions
- **Field Name Consistency**: Integration tests must match actual data structure field names (e.g., `civ_id` not `civilization_id`)
- **Test Threshold Statistics**: Adjust test thresholds based on sample size and statistical variance (e.g., 20 samples at 1.67% error = 1 error = 5% rate, use 2% threshold not <1%)
