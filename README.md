# Galaxy - AI Civilization Evolution Simulator

This project simulates how AI civilizations can discover solutions that surpass human capabilities. It is designed to run directly on local machines, allowing you to observe the evolutionary process in action.

## Prototype Philosophy

**LLM Role**: Instead of solving problems directly, the LLM generates and proposes **"strategies," "heuristics," and "surrogate models"** as code. This creative process is simulated through the LLM_propose_strategy function.

**Evolution Process**: Each AI civilization (agent group) proposes strategies that are executed and evaluated in a "Crucible" environment. Superior strategies are selected by the "Evolutionary Engine" and become the foundation for the next generation.

**Purpose**: These prototypes aim to verify whether the process of discovering better solutions can be automated and accelerated, rather than completely solving the problem.

**This Prototype**: AI civilizations are tasked with inventing surrogate models to accelerate computationally expensive N-body simulations (gravitational calculations). Fitness is evaluated based on the balance between the surrogate model's prediction accuracy and computational speed.

## What This Achieves

### Proven Results

This prototype has demonstrated measurable improvements in automated code generation and evolution:

#### Code Quality & Reliability
- **49% Syntax Error Reduction**: Improved from 3.3% to 1.67% through prompt engineering (PR #12)
- **96.7% Validation Success**: First production run achieved high code generation reliability
- **98.3% LLM Success Rate**: Consistent across multiple evolution runs (PR #14, #21, #23)

#### Performance Optimization
- **2x Fitness Improvement**: Evolution consistently doubles baseline fitness (Gen 0 → Gen 4)
- **Code Bloat Prevention**: Penalty system reduced token count by 5.4% without fitness loss (PR #21)
- **Penalty Tuning**: Threshold optimization improved relevance by 2.2x (PR #23, 11.1% vs 5% application rate)

#### Cost Efficiency
- **$0.02 per Full Run**: Typical cost for 50 API calls (10 population × 5 generations)
- **20 Runs per Day**: Within free tier limit (1,000 requests/day)
- **Sub-penny Experiments**: Mini runs (2 gen × 3 pop) cost ~$0.002

#### Evolution Effectiveness
- **Non-monotonic Progress**: Fitness fluctuates during exploration (healthy search behavior)
- **Best-Ever Tracking**: Cumulative maximum fitness clearly visible (PR #23)
- **Adaptive Mutation**: Early exploration (temp=1.0) then exploitation (temp=0.6)

#### Visualization & Analysis
- **5 Comprehensive Plots**: Fitness, accuracy/speed trade-offs, token evolution, cost tracking
- **High-Resolution Output**: 300 DPI publication-quality visualizations
- **Complete History**: JSON export for custom analysis

### Real-World Validation

**Production Runs** (from Session Handover):
- PR #23: 60 API calls, $0.0219 cost, best fitness=27,879.23
- PR #21: 150 API calls across 3 test runs, $0.05 total
- PR #16: 9 API calls, $0.002, validated all visualizations
- PR #14: 60 API calls, $0.02, 98.3% success rate

**Runtime**: ~4 minutes per full evolution (rate-limited to 15 RPM)

### Scientific Contribution

This work demonstrates:
1. **LLMs as Code Generators**: Using LLMs in evolutionary frameworks rather than direct problem solving
2. **Automatic Discovery**: Exploring solution space without human guidance
3. **Multi-Layer Safety**: AST validation + sandbox execution + output validation
4. **Cost-Effective Research**: Free-tier API enables large-scale experiments

### Current Limitations

**Technical Limitations:**
- Single LLM provider (Gemini only)
- Fixed generation count (no convergence detection)
- Single problem domain (N-body simulation)
- Whitespace-based token counting (inaccurate)

**Planned Improvements** (see Session Handover → Next Priority Tasks):
- Multi-LLM support (Claude, GPT-4o)
- Convergence detection and early stopping
- Advanced algorithms (crossover, multi-objective optimization)
- tiktoken migration for accurate token counting
- Code modularization for better maintainability

## Setup

### Requirements
- Python 3.10 or higher
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) package manager (recommended) or pip
- Google AI API key (free)

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/TheIllusionOfLife/Galaxy.git
cd Galaxy
```

2. **Install uv (if not already installed)**
```bash
# macOS/Linux
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Windows
powershell -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"

# Alternative: with pip
pip install uv
```

3. **Install dependencies**
```bash
# With uv (recommended - faster and more reliable)
uv sync --extra dev

# Alternative: with pip
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

**Why uv?** uv is 10-100x faster than pip and provides reproducible installs via `uv.lock`. Dependencies install in seconds instead of minutes.

4. **Configure API key**
- Get a free API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey)
- Create a `.env` file in the project root:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```
- Edit the `.env` file and set your API key:
```
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
```

**Note**: All configuration settings (model selection, hyperparameters, feature flags) are defined in `config.yaml` (single source of truth). The `.env` file only contains API keys (secrets).

## Configuration

### Configuration Architecture

The project follows the "Once and Only Once" (DRY) principle for configuration:

- **`config.yaml`** - Single source of truth for ALL configuration defaults
  - Model selection (gemini-2.5-flash-lite)
  - Hyperparameters (temperature, tokens, etc.)
  - Evolution parameters (population, generations, elite ratio)
  - Feature flags (rate limiting, code penalty, etc.)

- **`.env`** - Secrets ONLY (API keys)
  - Never contains configuration parameters
  - Only stores sensitive credentials

- **Environment variables** - Optional one-off overrides
  - Can override any config.yaml setting for specific runs
  - Example: `POPULATION_SIZE=20 uv run python prototype.py`

### Customizing Configuration

Edit `config.yaml` to customize behavior (all parameters documented with comments):

```yaml
# Model Configuration
model:
  name: gemini-2.5-flash-lite  # Change model
  temperature: 0.8             # Adjust creativity (0.0-2.0)
  max_output_tokens: 2000      # Limit response length

# Evolution Parameters
evolution:
  population_size: 10    # Models per generation
  num_generations: 5     # Total generations
  elite_ratio: 0.2       # Top performers kept (0.0-1.0)

# Code Length Penalty (prevent bloat)
code_penalty:
  enabled: true          # Enable/disable feature
  weight: 0.1           # Penalty strength (0.0-1.0)
  max_tokens: 2000      # Threshold before penalty
```

**Important**: Never duplicate settings. Each parameter has exactly ONE definition in `config.yaml`.

## Usage

### Basic Execution

```bash
# Run evolutionary optimization
uv run python prototype.py

# Alternative: with pip/venv (activate virtual environment first)
source .venv/bin/activate  # if using venv
python prototype.py
```

### Execution Results

The program outputs:
- **Console:** Evaluation results for each generation (fitness, accuracy, speed)
- **Console:** Top-performing models and LLM usage statistics
- **Files:** Automatically generated visualization and data export

#### Visualization and Data Export

After evolution completes, results are automatically saved to a timestamped directory (`results/run_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS/`):

1. **evolution_history.json** - Complete evolution history with summary statistics
   - All generations, populations, fitness values
   - Best/average/worst fitness per generation
   - Total models evaluated and best overall fitness

2. **fitness_progression.png** - Line plot showing fitness over generations
   - Best, average, and worst fitness trends
   - Identifies improvement/stagnation patterns

3. **accuracy_vs_speed.png** - Scatter plot of accuracy vs speed trade-offs
   - Each point represents one model from any generation
   - Color indicates fitness level
   - Reveals Pareto frontier of speed/accuracy balance

4. **token_progression.png** - Code length evolution over generations
   - Average, maximum, and minimum token counts per generation
   - Individual model scatter overlay colored by fitness
   - Monitors code bloat and validates length penalty effectiveness

5. **cost_progression.png** - Cumulative cost over API calls
   - Tracks spending throughout evolution
   - Helps validate cost estimates

Example output:
```

- **Execution cost**: Approximately $0.02/run (2% of budget)
- **Rate limiting**: Automatically maintains 15 RPM

### Testing

Test API connection:
```bash
uv run python test_gemini_connection.py
```

Run unit tests:
```bash
# Run all tests (excluding integration tests)
uv run pytest tests/ -m "not integration"

# Run all tests including integration tests (requires API key)
uv run pytest tests/

# Run with coverage
uv run pytest tests/ --cov --cov-report=html
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Setup Issues

#### "GOOGLE_API_KEY not set" Error

**Error Message:**
```
ValidationError: GOOGLE_API_KEY
  Field required [type=missing, input_value={}, input_type=dict]
```

**Solution:**

1. Create `.env` file from template:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. Get API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey)

3. Edit `.env` and add your key:
   ```
   GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
   ```

4. Verify configuration:
   ```bash
   uv run python test_gemini_connection.py
   ```

---

#### Rate Limit Errors (429 Too Many Requests)

**Error Message:**
```
google.api_core.exceptions.TooManyRequests: 429 Quota exceeded
```

**Solution:**

Ensure rate limiting is enabled in `config.yaml`:
```yaml
rate_limiting:
  enabled: true
  requests_per_minute: 15
```

**If still occurring:**
- Free tier: 15 requests/minute, 1,000 requests/day
- Wait 1 minute before retrying
- Reduce `population_size` or `num_generations` in config.yaml

---

#### Integration Test Failures (No API Key)

**Error Message:**
```
SKIPPED [1] tests/test_integration.py:15: API key required
```

**This is normal!** Integration tests require a real API key and are automatically skipped in CI.

To run integration tests locally:
```bash
# Set API key in .env first
uv run pytest tests/ -m integration
```

CI automatically excludes integration tests:
```bash
pytest tests/ -m "not integration"  # CI command
```

---

#### Import Errors After Fresh Clone

**Error Message:**
```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'google.generativeai'
```

**Solution:**

Install all dependencies including dev tools:
```bash
uv sync --extra dev
```

Or with pip:
```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

---

#### Code Validation Failures

**Error Message:**
```
ValidationResult(valid=False, errors=['Forbidden: import statement'])
```

**Cause:** LLM generated code with forbidden operations (imports, file I/O, etc.)

**This is expected behavior:**
- Validation prevents malicious code execution
- System automatically falls back to parametric model
- Check `code_validator.py` for allowed operations

**To reduce validation failures:**
- Lower `temperature` in `config.yaml` (more conservative)
- Review prompt engineering in `prompts.py`
- Check Session Learnings below for prompt patterns

---

#### Type Checking Errors (Local vs CI Differences)

**Issue:** Mypy passes locally but fails in CI (or vice versa)

**Cause:** Different type stub availability between environments

**Solution:**

Use `typing.Any` for parameters with environment-dependent types:
```python
from typing import Any

# Instead of:
config: GenerationConfig = {...}  # May fail in CI

# Use:
config: Any = {...}  # Works in both environments
```

See PR #7 commits for examples.

---

#### YAML Configuration Errors

**Error Message:**
```
yaml.scanner.ScannerError: mapping values are not allowed here
```

**Cause:** Invalid YAML syntax in `config.yaml`

**Solution:**

1. Check indentation (use spaces, not tabs)
2. For consistency, add a space after colons (`key: value` is preferred over `key:value`)
3. Validate YAML syntax online: https://www.yamllint.com/

Example of correct syntax:
```yaml
model:
  name: gemini-2.5-flash-lite
  temperature: 0.8
```

#### Next Priority Tasks

1. **Phase 2: Baseline Surrogates & Benchmarks** (HIGH PRIORITY)
   - **Source**: MIGRATION_STATUS.md Phase 2 planning
   - **Context**: Phase 1 complete (3D N-body physics), need reference implementations
   - **Tasks**:
     - Implement scipy.spatial KDTree baseline (O(N log N) approximation)
     - Create standard test problems (Plummer sphere, two-body Kepler orbit, three-body figure-8)
     - Add validation metrics (energy drift, trajectory RMSE, momentum conservation)
     - Build comprehensive benchmark suite with scaling analysis
   - **Benefits**: Scientific validation, performance baselines, publishable results
   - **Estimated time**: 2-3 days
   - **Approach**: Start with KDTree baseline, then standard problems, then metrics

2. **Code Modularization** (MEDIUM PRIORITY - Deferred)
   - **Source**: 4/5 reviewers consensus from previous planning
   - **Context**: prototype.py now at 1044 lines after Phase 1 migration
   - **Goal**: Extract to galaxy/ package structure for SOLID principles
   - **Structure**:
     ```text
     galaxy/
     ├── core/ (genome.py, evolution.py, selection.py)
     ├── crucible/ (base.py, nbody.py)
     ├── llm/ (client.py, gemini.py)
     └── prototype.py (main orchestration, ~100 lines)
     ```
   - **Benefits**: Easier domain extension, testable in isolation, reduced cognitive load
   - **Priority**: Deferred until Phase 2 complete (avoid disrupting working physics)
   - **Estimated time**: 3-4 hours

3. **Adaptive Timestep Integration** (OPTIONAL)
   - **Source**: MIGRATION_STATUS.md open question, claude[bot] review
   - **Context**: Current dt=0.1 may be too large for tight orbits
   - **Enhancement**: Variable timestep based on particle proximity
   - **Benefits**: Better accuracy for close encounters, maintains performance
   - **Priority**: Low (current leapfrog <10% drift acceptable for prototype)
   - **Estimated time**: 2 hours

#### Known Issues / Blockers
- **Non-monotonic Fitness**: Fitness fluctuates between generations (not guaranteed to improve)
  - Expected behavior during exploration phase, not a bug

#### Session Learnings

**Last Updated**: October 31, 2025 12:49 AM JST

- **Empirical Feature Validation Pattern** (2025-10-31): Always validate new features with controlled experiments before declaring success
  - **Trigger**: PR #26 merged crossover feature, needed to validate effectiveness
  - **Approach**: 3 comparative runs (control, 30%, 50%) with consistent methodology
  - **Results**: Crossover 50% showed +5.3% fitness, +11.6pp improvement rate vs control
  - **Decision**: Updated default config based on empirical data, not assumptions
  - **Pattern**: Don't rely on intuition - measure real impact with controlled experiments
  - **Cost**: $0.08 for comprehensive validation vs potentially keeping ineffective feature

- **GitHub Workflow OIDC Token Validation** (2025-10-30 from PR #26): Workflow file modifications require exact match with main
  - **Problem**: claude-code-review workflow failed with 401 OIDC token exchange error
  - **Root Cause**: Security feature validates workflow files match between PR branch and main branch
  - **Solution**: Either temporarily skip the PR (`if: github.event.pull_request.number != 26`) or merge workflow changes to main first
  - **Pattern**: When modifying `.github/workflows/*` files, expect OIDC validation to fail until merged to main
- **CI Permission Requirements Mapping** (2025-10-30 from PR #26): GitHub CLI commands need specific workflow permissions
  - **Discovery**: `gh pr comment` requires `pull-requests: write`, not just `read`
  - **Pattern**: Map CLI commands to GitHub Actions permissions before using in workflows
  - **Common Mappings**: `gh pr comment` → `pull-requests: write`, `gh pr view` → `pull-requests: read`, `git push` → `contents: write`
- **Post-Fix Verification Discipline** (2025-10-30 from PR #26): Always run quick checks before declaring fixes complete
  - **Why**: Prevents reporting "fixed" when issues still exist (builds trust, saves time)
  - **Approach**: Run 1-2 relevant commands (typecheck, quick test) immediately after fix
  - **Example**: After CI fix, ran `gh pr checks` to verify all tests passing before reporting success
- **Refactoring for Testability** (2025-10-30 from PR #23): Extract calculations to pure functions for robust testing
  - **Trigger**: Code review feedback suggesting tests are weak or implicit
  - **Problem**: Calculation embedded in plotting function → hard to test edge cases directly
  - **Solution**: Extract `calculate_best_ever_fitness()` as separate function with comprehensive docstring
  - **Result**: Added 5 unit tests (monotonic, inf, nan, all-inf, empty) - 71 total tests passing
  - **Pattern**: When reviewers say "test doesn't explicitly verify X", extract X to testable function
- **Test Analysis Documentation Clarity** (2025-10-30 from PR #23): Always explain number discrepancies
  - **Trigger**: Reviewer questioned "5/45 vs 50 models" discrepancy in test analysis
  - **Problem**: Using denominators that differ from total counts without explanation
  - **Solution**: Explicitly document "45/50 (5 failed validation)" before showing percentages
  - **Pattern**: When denominators ≠ total attempts, explain what's excluded (failures, timeouts, etc.)
- **Integration Testing Global Settings Patch** (2025-10-30 from PR #21): `monkeypatch.setenv()` alone insufficient for testing module-level settings
  - **Problem**: Test using `monkeypatch.setenv("PENALTY_WEIGHT", "0.2")` but code still uses default 0.1
  - **Root Cause**: Modules import `settings` at load time; env changes don't update existing references
  - **Solution**: Reload settings + patch ALL module references: `monkeypatch.setattr(config_module, "settings", test_settings)`
  - **Detection**: Test passes but doesn't actually vary parameter being tested
  - **Pattern**: Always patch global references when testing module-level config objects

**Historical Learnings** (detailed patterns in personal reference files: `~/.claude/core-patterns.md` and `~/.claude/domain-patterns.md` - these are user-level patterns spanning all projects):
- GraphQL PR review efficiency, Zip pattern optimization, Complete test coverage for edge cases
- TDD with real API integration, Security review priority, Code simplification from AI review
- Test assertion precision, Prompt engineering for completeness, Statistical testing importance
- uv migration, Make target purpose, Test robustness, Pre-commit setup, Reviewer priority
